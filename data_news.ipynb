confusing neutral often runs centre room taps fixture hot wire tended run one fixture next cases kt isnt colourcoded neutral often colour hot wires youll see kt homes built late comments kt people installing kt pretty paranoid electricity workmanship tends pretty good wire insulation insulators tend stand well kt ive seen example quite good condition grounding grounding usually difficult install boxes small receptacle replacement particularly gfci difficult bushing boxes either wiring changes need special attention box entry sometimes neutral isnt balanced well separately hot circuits sometimes possible overload neutral without exceeding fusing circuit building code permit insulation walls contain kt connection existing kt new circuits tricky consult inspector modern wiring practise requires considerably outlets installed kt systems since kt tends pretty decent condition generally isnt necessary replace simply kt watch renovations interfered cautious circuit loading many cases perfectly reasonable leave existing kt alone add new fixtures new circuits using modern techniques kt invented multiconductor cable first type see roughly cloth varnish insulation looks much like romex cable last decade two stuff used grounding conductor installed much like modern wiring major drawback type insulation embrittles weve seen whole systems insulation would fracture fall touch bx cable vintage similar problems stuff fragile becomes rather hazardous wires become bare wiring left untouched much possible whenever opportunity arises replace simple receptacle switch replacement turn several hour long frustrating fight electrical tape heatshrink tubing wiring technique modern romex invented almost asphalt impregnated cloth often bit sticky stuff stands reasonably well doesnt
